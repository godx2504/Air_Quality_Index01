Predicting Air Quality Index Using Regression
# 🌍 Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using Python

Air pollution is a growing concern globally. With increasing industrialization and urbanization, it is crucial to **monitor and predict air quality in real-time**.  
One of the most reliable ways to quantify air pollution is by calculating the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**.

In this project, we explore **how to predict AQI using Python**, leveraging **data science tools** and **machine learning algorithms**.

## 📌 What is AQI?

The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** is a standardized indicator used to communicate **how polluted the air currently is** or **how polluted it is forecast to become**.

The AQI is calculated based on key pollutants:

- **PM2.5**
- **PM10**
- **NO₂**
- **SO₂**
- **CO**
- **O₃**

Each pollutant has a **sub-index**, and the **highest sub-index** among them becomes the AQI.

## 📐 AQI Formula

The AQI for a pollutant is calculated using:

Where:
- **I** → AQI
- **C** → Concentration of the pollutant
- **BP_HI, BP_LO** → Breakpoint concentrations
- **I_HI, I_LO** → AQI values corresponding to those breakpoints

## 📊 AQI Levels

| AQI Level                     | AQI Range |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| Good                          | 0 - 50    |
| Moderate                      | 51 - 100  |
| Unhealthy                     | 101 - 150 |
| Unhealthy for Sensitive People| 151 - 200 |
| Hazardous                     | 201+      |

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Collect Data** → Gather pollutant concentration data from APIs or datasets.  
2. **Preprocess Data** → Clean missing values, normalize units, and prepare features.  
3. **Calculate AQI** → Use the formula for each pollutant and select the maximum sub-index.  
4. **Machine Learning** → Train regression or classification models to predict AQI from pollutant data.  
5. **Visualization** → Plot AQI trends, compare regions, and forecast future AQI values.
